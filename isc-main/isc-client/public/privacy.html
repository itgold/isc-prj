            Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
            It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
            Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

            Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
            work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
            Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h1><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
    <h2><strong>LOOP Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
    <h3><strong>Posted and Effective: Feb 25, 2019</strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for using File Finder! Our mission is help you leave work on time, if not early, by making your day more productive with easy to use products and services.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this privacy policy we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal information when you use our websites, software, and services ("</span><strong>Services</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">").</span></p>
    <h2><strong>What &amp; Why</strong></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, and protect our Services:</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account information. We collect, and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do things such as sign up for your account, upgrade to a paid plan, and set up two-factor authentication (like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address). Some of our Services let you access your accounts and your information via other service providers.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attachments. Our Services are designed to make it simple for you to store your files, documents, photos, and all your other attachments you exchange or share between communication platforms ("</span><strong>Attachments</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">"), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Attachments as well as information related to it. This related information includes your profile information that makes it easier to collaborate and share Attachments with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity. Our Services provide you with different options for sharing Attachments.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contacts. You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you to do things like share and collaborate on Attachments, send messages, and invite others to use the Services. If you do, we'll store those contacts on our servers for you to use across any device you access our services.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usage information. We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like viewing, sharing and moving files or folders). We use this information to improve our Services, develop new services and features, and protect File Finder users.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Device information. We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of operating system, browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings you control) may also transmit location information to the Services.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies and other technologies. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, so you do not have to re-log in every time, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing. We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge. These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services or the person that shared a folder is an already paying member. If you register for our free Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about upgrades when permissible. Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time. If you do not want to receive marketing materials from us, simply click the 'unsubscribe' link in any email.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We sometimes contact people who do not have a paid File Finder account. For recipients in the EU, we or a third party will obtain consent before contacting you. If you receive an email and no longer wish to be contacted by File Finder, you can unsubscribe and remove yourself from our contact list via the message itself.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bases for processing your data. We collect and use the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Services in a reliable and secure manner. We also collect and use personal data for our legitimate business needs. To the extent we process your personal data for other purposes, we ask for your consent in advance or require that our partners obtain such consent.</span></p>
    <h2><strong>With Whom</strong></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other third parties.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others working for and with File Finder. File Finder uses certain trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT services) to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and we'll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other users. Our Services may display information like your name, profile picture, device, and email address to other users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications. You can also share Attachments with other users if you choose. When you register your File Finder account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, we may help collaborators and administrators find you and your team by making some of your basic information&mdash;like your name, team name, profile picture, and email address&mdash;visible to other users on the same domain. This helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain features let you make additional information available to others.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other applications. You can also give third-party providers access to your information and account&mdash;for example, via File Finder APIs. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">File Finder Team Admins. If you are a user of an File Finder team or business account your administrator may have the ability to access and control your File Finder team account. Please refer to your organization's internal policies if you have questions about this. If you are not an File Finder team user but interact with an File Finder team user (by, for example, joining a shared folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view the name, email address, profile picture, and IP address that was associated with your account at the time of that interaction.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law &amp; Order and the Public Interest. We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government request; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of File Finder or our users; (d) protect File Finder's rights, property, safety, or interest; or (e) perform a task carried out in the public interest.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that your data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it's stored on our Services or on your home computer's hard drive. We'll abide by Government Request Principles when receiving, scrutinizing, and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for your data:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be transparent,</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fight blanket requests,</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protect all users, and</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide trusted services.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>How</strong></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security. We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account. We deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behavior and content that may harm our Services, you, or other users.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Controls. You can access, amend, download, and delete your personal information by logging into your File Finder account and going to your account settings page.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retention. When you sign up for an account with us, we'll retain information you store on our Services for as long as your account is in existence or as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we will initiate deletion of this information after 30 days. This helps you assure information does not exist and it helps our costs not storing unneeded information. Please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.</span></p>
    <h2><strong>Where</strong></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the world. To provide you with the Services, we may store, process, and transmit information in the United States and locations around the world&mdash;including those outside your country. Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. When transferring data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, File Finder relies upon a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts with our customers and affiliates. File Finder complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss&ndash;U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland to the United States.</span></p>
    <h2><strong>Changes</strong></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.</span></p>
    <h2><strong>Your Right to Control and Access Your Information</strong></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have control over your personal information and how it is collected, used, and shared. For example, you have a right to:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erase or delete all or some of Attachments in your File Finder account. You can contact us at any time.</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change or correct personal data. You can manage your account and the content contained in it, as well as edit some of your personal data, through your account settings page. We require you to maintain true and accurate information in your account.</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access and take your data. You can download a copy of Attachments in a machine-readable format by requesting it from us. You can also ask us for a copy of personal data you provided to us.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Contact</strong></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your personal information is controlled by File Finder. Have questions or concerns about File Finder, our Services, and privacy? Contact our Data Protection Officer at Privacy@Attachment.cloud. If they can't answer your question, you have the right to contact your local data protection supervisory authority.</span></p>
